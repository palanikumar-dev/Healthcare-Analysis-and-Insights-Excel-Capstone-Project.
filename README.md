🏥 **HEALTH CARE ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS**

**Excel Capstone Project Report** 

**Project Overview**

* The Health Care Analysis and Insights project focuses on analyzing healthcare-related data to identify patterns, trends, and key performance indicators that support better decision-making in the healthcare system.
* The project uses Microsoft Excel to transform raw healthcare data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

**Objectives**

* The main objectives of this project are:

* To analyze healthcare data and identify key trends

* To evaluate patient distribution and service performance

* To understand cost, treatment, and outcome patterns

* To present insights clearly using Excel dashboards and reports

**Dataset Description**

* The dataset contains structured healthcare information such as:

* Patient demographics (age, gender, location)

* Hospital or department details

* Treatment or service information

* Cost and billing data

* Admission and discharge details

* Health outcomes or service usage metrics

Each row represents an individual healthcare record, while columns define different healthcare attributes.

**Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency:

* Removed duplicate records

* Handled missing or null values

* Standardized date formats and numeric values

* Corrected inconsistent category names

* Created calculated columns for analysis

Excel functions such as IF, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, TEXT, ROUND, and conditional formatting were used during this stage.

**Data Analysis Methodology**

* The cleaned data was analyzed using:

* Pivot Tables to summarize large datasets

* Filters and slicers for dynamic analysis

* Aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, and PERCENTAGE

* Time-based analysis to identify trends over periods

This approach enabled quick comparison across departments, patients, and services.

**Key Metrics Analyzed**

* The project focuses on important healthcare KPIs, including:

* Total number of patients

* Department-wise patient distribution

* Average treatment cost

* Admission and discharge trends

* Length of hospital stay

* Service utilization rates

**Visualizations & Dashboard**

* An interactive dashboard was created using Excel charts such as:

* Bar charts for department-wise analysis

* Line charts for trend analysis over time

* Pie charts for patient or service distribution

* KPI cards highlighting key numbers

**Key Insights & Findings**

* Some major insights derived from the analysis include:

* Certain departments show consistently higher patient inflow

* Treatment costs vary significantly across departments

* Peak admission periods indicate higher resource demand

* Specific services contribute the most to overall healthcare costs

Data trends help identify areas requiring operational improvement

**Business & Healthcare Impact**

* The insights from this project can help:

* Hospital management optimize resource allocation

* Improve patient care planning

* Identify cost-intensive services

* Support data-driven healthcare decisions

Enhance operational efficiency and service quality

**Tools & Technologies Used**

* Microsoft Excel

* Data Cleaning

* Pivot Tables

* Charts & Dashboards

* Excel Functions

Analytical Thinking & Reporting

**Challenges Faced**

* Handling missing and inconsistent data

* Managing large datasets efficiently

* Designing clear and meaningful visualizations

* Ensuring accuracy in calculated metrics

**Conclusion**

The Health Care Analysis and Insights project demonstrates how Excel can be effectively used to analyze healthcare data and generate valuable insights.
The project highlights the importance of data cleaning, structured analysis, and visualization in supporting informed decision-making within the healthcare domain.
